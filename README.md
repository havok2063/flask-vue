# flask-vue
Example of Vue combined with Flask

This repo sets up a back-end Flask web server with a Vue front-end client, using Bootstrap 
components and styling, with Bootstrap-Vue for Bootstrap-themed Vue components.  

## Original Tutorial
This repo generated from the following [tutorial](https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-flask-and-vuejs/#flask-setup)

Note, in place of `npm` package installation in the tutorial, I use `yarn add [package]`.

## Initial directory creation
```
mkdir flask-vue
cd flask-vue
mkdir server
vue create client
```
You must have Vue installed to run `vue create client`
